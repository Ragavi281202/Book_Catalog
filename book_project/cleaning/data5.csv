Each member of the tribe has a metal horn and hooves. They also have magical powers based on the properties of their metals.Alumna starts out the book by introducing the very necessary metal, aluminum, on her element page. Dr. Zinko rounds out the alphabet by presenting facts and other fun information about the metal, zinc, on his element page. Other members of the Metal Horn Tribe from Unimaise, plus some of their magical elemental friends, will give some great insight into the properties of 23 additional pure metals from the periodic table. There is one special unicorn in the book whose horn and hooves are an alloy created by combining copper and zinc. Cornum, the Brass Horned unicorn will reveal some interesting things about that metal.While not all elements in the Periodic Table are represented by letters of the alphabet, some in this book, are introduced by alternate designations. For instance, Tungsten is also known as Wolfram so W is used as the entry for that alphabetical letter in this book. The letter W is also used as the atomic symbol for tungsten in all periodic tables.Each element page in this book contains terms that might not be completely familiar. Refer to the definitions in the back of the book to get a clear understanding of each meaning. There is also a fun unicorn themed Periodic Table at the back of the book.The Metal Horn unicorns from Unimaise and their other techno-magical unicorn friends are the perfect group to introduce you to metals and other elements in the Periodic Table.

The plan will be approved and implemented by the spy branch of the Iraq government, the Tariq'Allah, the Shining Star of Allah.It starts with the kidnapping of two wives of military intelligence officers, Paul Remmich and Eric Miller. Threatened with their spouses deaths, they are forced to go to Istanbul. Hoping to soften the mens animosity and gain their willing assistance, the Iraqis plan a lavish distraction. Unfortunately, the trip to a Mediterranean resort with their wives doesnt quite work out as the spy organization hoped. The CIA slips into the picture, determined to save the womens lives and get them out of Turkey.Forced to adjust their plan, the Tariq'Allah selects Paul Remmich to negotiate for the weapon in Washington, DC. When the officer presents the demand for the weapon, its rejection places his and Miller's life squarely in danger.Upon Remmich's return to Turkey, he finds the failure angers and humiliates the Iraqis, and more time passes as they consider their options. When the only recourse appears to be the death of the Americans, the CIA again attempts a rescue with a clever scheme. Enraged by the attempt, Tariq'Allah follows the escape path, and a gunfight ensues.

After the terrible encounters with the war heroes, the Intuitionist is on the verge of breaking all promises she gave to her friends and her family. both the war heroes might become aware of her powerher intuition, for she is their shortcut, their cheat code.
As the Monk looks into the Oldest Dance, he nearly discovers the first language of mankind, or perhaps, the first language on earth. It could take him to the Source, he believes. But he can't do that without the Devil's Book--the book that now belongs to the Mesmerizer.Soon enough, they realize that none may find what they seek unless they have the power to guess things right. Soon enough, they know who might be their Cheat Code to achieve it all.And thus, the Intuitionist fights the whispers of the ones with voice. Her purpose calls her, but she has her life to deal with--a life that is too trivial compared to the ones who want her home. And it's not easy when she must handle all promises she has made, not when the oldest dance of the universe whispers in her dreams and when the Devil's Book calls her still.In a world of voice where High Grades are too proud to lie, a promise made verbally is stronger than a red seal. So she must leave her mother's nest while keeping her promises, and in her journey, she must be aware of the whispers of the war heroes.","[""Published April 18, 2023""]",https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15178124.Misba,Misba,322,"[""Fantasy"", ""Science Fiction Fantasy"", ""Science Fiction"", ""Post Apocalyptic"", ""Adventure"", ""Thriller"", ""Adult""]",2661,924,4.59,"{""5"": ""1,760"", ""4"": ""747"", ""3"": ""131"", ""2"": ""18"", ""1"": ""5""}"

Maeve OShaughnessys fight for survival was different. Her three brothers were shipped out and left her with their new detective agency and fifteen-year-old brother to manage. Before the War, Maeve worked as a secretary. She knew nothing about detective agencies. From the start she struggled to make enough money to feed Jimmy and herself. Vic Marino, a no-nonsense ex-cop, showed up and told her he was going to help her make a go of the agency. Maeve vehemently protested but Vic insisted she had no choice.Against the backdrop of a war many Americans never wanted, more men were drafted and volunteered to serve every day. Those left behind supported the war effort the best they could. As 1942 wore on sacrifices were necessary for the War, while the losses became real and heartbreaking. Thousands of women took up the cause working outside the home. Yet Maeve found herself trapped in circumstances beyond her control.Vics deal to help the detective agency survive came at a cost. He took on responsibility for the detective agency along with an angry nave woman and her teenage brother. The business was sinking and needed to make money fast. They needed a client. One walked in on Vics first day in the office. Mrs. Sullivan implored them for help. Her daughter Lucille, a beautiful angel, was brutally murdered in an expensive apartment owned by a rich businessman. The police showed no interest in her violent death. Maeve and Vic had no choice. They took the case nobody wanted.From the mean streets of Brooklyn to Chinatown to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the Fulton Fish Market to upstate New York, dealing with thugs, colorful characters, and puzzling clues, OShaughnessy Investigations, Inc. pursued the baffling case.

When wealthy American adolescent Matthew Cameron moves to France following his parents' divorce, he struggles to assimilate to his new surroundings. But when a new tennis instructor -- Michel Garnier -- arrives at Matthew's boarding school, a forbidden relationship develops that will have unforeseen consequences. Published in 1951, Finistre is a trailblazing LGBTQ+ novel. It locates tragedy not in the same-sex nature of the relationship between Matthew and Michel, but rather in the failure of their family, and wider society, to accept their relationship. Having sold over 350,000 copies, Fritz Peters's most successful novel kicked off the explosion of unapologetically gay literature that would be published in the next decades in the United States and Britain. In this context, Finistre was meaningful to a generation of queer readers who struggled to encounter literature that depicted their reality respectfully. However, Finistre is a meditation on more than just homosexuality and forbidden love. Through its sensitively rendered characters, Peters illuminates culture clash, class conflict, divorce, child-rearing, and the gaps in empathy that can provoke lifes greatest pains. As such, Finistre is a transcendent novel that outlasts its historical moment and will appeal to all lovers of great literature.--It is difficult for most American authors to write a novel about a homosexual affair without making either a tract or an apologia. Mr. Peters has done neither. Instead, he has kept resolutely in focus his great theme: the corruption and murder of innocence. -GORE VIDAL","[""First published January 1, 1951""]",https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/151154.Fritz_Peters,Fritz Peters,316,"[""Fiction"", ""LGBT"", ""Queer"", ""Classics"", ""Gay"", ""Gay Fiction"", ""Literary Fiction""]",129,22,3.77,"{""5"": ""36"", ""4"": ""41"", ""3"": ""41"", ""2"": ""8"", ""1"": ""3""}"

Their dead ends and diversions are the repercussions of haphazard decisions made by their unexamined selves. Battle-worn or overprotected, the travelers must navigate the ennui of their ostensibly peaceful surroundings. Peters does a remarkable job of capturing the motivations of both male and female characters, how they struggle to understand each other and coexist, and what territory can only be ceded in the gaps of understanding they encounter. What emerges is a striking representation of post-World War II United States, but the insights contained within are timeless. The Descent shows how catastrophe is a fact of life; that life is given to us on a silver platter, and what we do with it is up to us.--Largely focused on the proverbial war of the sexes, with enough suspense and brilliant analysis to satisfy anyone familiar with Peters earlier outstanding novels.NY TIMES BOOK REVIEW","[""First published January 1, 1952""]",https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/151154.Fritz_Peters,Fritz Peters,268,"[""Fiction""]",4,0,4.75,"{""5"": ""3"", ""4"": ""1"", ""3"": ""0"", ""2"": ""0"", ""1"": ""0""}"
